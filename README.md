A terrible programming language for the Shavian keyboard.
It's so bad the only way to hardcode a negative integer is subtaction (currently).

Supports boolean, integer, and string values; as well as named variables of the same. (No functional string processing or Arrays.)
Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations on integers.
Will attempt to convert strings and bools to integer via parse or hash.
Uses label goto and if statements for flow control.

Basic code: Defines a string; Accepts input; Displays input string:
'''
·𐑚𐑱𐑑𐑩 𐑦𐑟 𐑩 𐑕𐑑𐑮𐑦𐑙.
𐑐𐑳𐑑 𐑞 𐑮𐑩𐑕𐑰𐑝𐑛 𐑦𐑯𐑑𐑴 ·𐑚𐑱𐑑𐑩.
𐑛𐑦𐑕𐑐𐑤𐑲 ·𐑚𐑱𐑑𐑩.
