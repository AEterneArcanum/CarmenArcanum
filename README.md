A terrible programming language for the Shavian keyboard.
It's so bad the only way to hardcode a negative integer is subtaction (currently).

Supports boolean, integer, and string values; as well as named variables of the same. (No functional string processing or Arrays.)
Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations on integers.
Will attempt to convert strings and bools to integer via parse or hash.
Uses label goto and if statements for flow control.
